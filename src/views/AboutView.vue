        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Foodie Hub</strong> is a simulated food ordering web
          application that allows users to browse menus, add items to their
          cart, and experience a streamlined checkout process. The project
          integrates <strong>Omise</strong> for payment simulation, ensuring a
          realistic transaction workflow. With a responsive design and modern UI
          components, Foodie Hub delivers a delightful experience across
          devices.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          The platform features a
          <strong>role-based access control (RBAC)</strong> system, dividing
          users into three key roles: <strong>Regular Users</strong>,
          <strong>Store Owners</strong>, and <strong>Administrators</strong>.
          Each role comes with specific permissions and access levels:
        </p>

            manage their account details.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Store Owners:</strong> Have access to a dedicated dashboard
            to manage their restaurant profile, update menus, and monitor
            orders.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Administrators:</strong> Oversee the entire platform, manage
            user accounts, handle disputes, and monitor platform analytics.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Additionally, Foodie Hub includes a comprehensive
          <strong>monitoring dashboard</strong> that allows administrators and
          store owners to view key metrics, such as order statistics, revenue
          trends, and user activity. This feature ensures transparency,
          efficient management, and data-driven decision-making.
